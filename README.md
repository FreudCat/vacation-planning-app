# Vacation Weather

</div>
<br />

### Description

Users can obtain upcoming weather information for a specified location for a certain number of days.

<br />

### Purpose?

Perhaps you are being diligent and want to know what to pack for an upcoming vacation. Or, perhaps you are just curious and would like to know what the weather will be in Chicago a week from now. Either way, this app will satisfy your thirst for weather knowledge.

<br />

### What global problem is this trying to solve? How will this save us?

Sorry, there is no global issue that this app could possibly solve. This is just a fun, personal project that lets me work with Webpack, APIs, responsive design, and an Express backend. Something to humbly do/learn because I enjoy doing/learning it.

<br />
